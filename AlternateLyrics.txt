NDIAN CURRY RHAPSODY (to Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody")

Naan, just killed a man 
poppadom against his head 
Had lime pickle now he's dead. 
Naan, dinner's just begun 
But now I'm gonna crap it all away. 
Naan, ooh, ooh Didn't mean to make you cry 
Seen nothing yet just see the loo tomorrow 
Curry on, curry on 
Cause nothing really Madras. 

Too late, my dinner's gone 
Sends shivers down my spine 
Rectum aching all the time 
Goodbye onion bhaji, I've got to go 
Gotta leave you all behind and use the loo. 
Naan, ooh, ooh 
This doopiaza is so mild 
I sometimes wish we'd never come here at all. 

guitar solo 

I see a little chicken tikka on the side 
Rogan Josh, Rogan Josh, pass the chutney made of mango 
Vindaloo does nicely Very very spicy Meat! 
Byriani (Byriani) 
Byriani (Byriani) 
Byriani and a naan 
(A vindaloo loo loo loo) 
I've eaten balti, somebody help me 
He's eaten balti, get him to the lavatory 
Stand you well back 
'Case the loo is quarantined... 
Here it comes 
There it goes 
Technicolor yawn 
I chunder 
No! 
It's coming up again 
(There he goes) 
I chunder, it's coming back again 
(There he goes) 
Coming back again 
(up again) 
Here it comes again. 
(No no no no no no NO) 
On my knees, I'm on my knees 
On his knees, Oh, there he goes 
This vindaloo Is about to wreck my guts 
Poor me.. poor me...poor meee! 

guitar solo 

So you think you can chunder and then feel alright? 
So you try to eat curry and drink beer all night? 
Oh maybe, But now you'll puke like a baby 
Just had to come out 
It just had to come right out in here. 

guitar solo 

slow bit 

Korma, sag or bhuna 
bhaji, balti or naan 
Nothing makes a difference 
Nothing makes a difference 
To meee.... 

(Any way, the wind blows....shshshsh)
